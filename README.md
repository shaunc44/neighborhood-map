UDACITY - FRONTEND NANODEGREE - PROJECT 5 - NEIGHBORHOOD MAP
==================================================================
In this project I created a neighborhood map of downtown
Burlington, Vermont. This map includes a search by venue function
that isolates venues (locations) when text is entered in the 
search box but also filters the locations (indicated by markers) 
on the map.


INSTRUCTIONS
============
SEARCH FUNCTION:
	Enter a word or some text in the search box. The search 
	function will filter the list based on the text you entered.
THE LIST: 
	Click any venue in the list. Information from Foursquare will
	pop up.
MAP & MARKERS:
	Move the mouse over any of the markers. The infowindow will 
	pop up. Click the X in the upper-right-hand-corner of the 
	infowindow to close the window.


INSTALLATION
