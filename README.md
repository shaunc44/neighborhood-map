###NEIGHBORHOOD MAP
####*UDACITY - FRONT-END NANODEGREE - PROJECT 5*
In this project I created a neighborhood map of downtown
Burlington, Vermont. This map includes a search by venue function
that isolates venues (locations) when text is entered in the 
search box but also filters the locations (indicated by markers) 
on the map.

#####INSTRUCTIONS

######Menu Button:
	Toggle the menu button to create more space when viewing 
	location information.
######Search Function:
	Enter a word or some text in the search box. The search 
	function will filter the list based on the text you entered.
######The List: 
	Click any venue in the list. Information from Foursquare will
	pop up.
######Map & Markers:
	Click any of the markers and a Foursquare infowindow will 
	pop up. Click the X in the upper-right corner of the 
	infowindow to close the window.
